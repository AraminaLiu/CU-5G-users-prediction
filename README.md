# CU-5G-users-prediction

Chinese operators are interested in identifying what kind of users are target 5G customers in order to promote the sales of them. Despite unsupervised learning models performed well in predicting customer behavior, we were in-terested in employing supervised learning model, XGBOOST model, to pro-vide solid prediction. Besides, we were also interested in identifying the fea-tures and source-systems, which contribute more to the prediction. In this paper, we use XGBOOST model on data both from operation support system and business support system to predict future 5G mobile users. Results show that the XGBOOST model reaches the accuracy of nearly 70% in classifying 5G mobile users in general. In addition, streaming data from operation sup-port system tended to be more important in predicting models than that from business support system.
